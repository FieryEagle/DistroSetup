# DistroSetup
Sets up Ubuntu to be to my preference (Ubuntu 20.04 ONLY)

Install instructions
If you so desire to run code that is very personally designed for me, you'll need the following commands

`git clone https://github.com/FieryEagle/DistroSetup.git`


`cd DistroSetup`


`chmod +x ~/setup.sh`


`./setup.sh`
