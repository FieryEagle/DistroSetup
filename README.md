# DistroSetup
Sets up Ubuntu to be to my preference (Ubuntu 20.10 ONLY)

Very shittly made, only for personal use. If you look at the code and think, "There's a much better way to do this", trust me, I know

Install instructions
If you so desire to run code that is very personally designed for me, you'll need the following commands

`git clone https://github.com/FieryEagle/DistroSetup.git`


`cd DistroSetup`


`chmod +x ~/setup.sh`


`./setup.sh`
